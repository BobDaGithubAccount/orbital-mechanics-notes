  abstract = {A fundamental relation in celestial mechanics is Kepler's equation, linking an orbit's mean anomaly to its eccentric anomaly and eccentricity. Being transcendental, the equation cannot be directly solved for eccentric anomaly by conventional treatments; much work has been devoted to approximate methods. Here, we give an explicit integral solution, utilizing methods recently applied to the 'geometric goat problem' and to the dynamics of spherical collapse. The solution is given as a ratio of contour integrals; these can be efficiently computed via numerical integration for arbitrary eccentricities. The method is found to be highly accurate in practice, with our C++ implementation outperforming conventional root-finding and series approaches by a factor greater than two.},

  abstract = {The Cassini spacecraft has been operating in orbit around Saturn since 2004, during which time it has executed over 150 satellite encounters. Over this period, there have been several papers describing the orbit determination process and performance up through 2016 [1-5]. In April of 2017, Cassini will enter its Grand Finale mission phase when it will traverse the gap between the D-ring and the Saturn atmosphere twenty-two times before plunging deep into the atmosphere to end the mission. The lack of targeted satellite encounters during this period necessitates updates to the nominal Cassini Orbit Determination (OD) process. This paper describes these planned adaptations for the operation of the Grand Finale. During the Equinox and Solstice Mission Phase (2008-2016), navigation analysis has been divided into segments focused on two particular targeted satellite encounters, called an ``arc''. Maneuvers in an arc were usually targeted to encounter B-plane position and time, so the OD state and covariance were mapped forward to the B-plane of the encounter within the arc. Trajectory dispersions during the Grand Finale need instead to be mapped to equator crossings and targeted Cartesian positions. In addition, trajectory arcs have typically covered a few orbital revolutions (\textasciitilde 2-8 weeks), in order to span the time between two encounters. However, the Grand Finale will encompass five months of time without an encounter which necessitates an adjusted arc strategy. A modified arc strategy was developed based on OD behavior during long multi-rev periods between encounters in the year leading up to the Grand Finale. The OD covariance study conducted for the Grand Finale mission phase will also be examined.},
